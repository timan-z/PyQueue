I have circular imports that I need to take care of in the refactoring phase.
For example:
```
# queue.py
from system.worker import Worker

# worker.py
from models.queue import Queue
```
This comes from the SpringQueue translation, where is taken care of by way of SpringBoot features
that aren't a thing over here.

[For later doc]:
^ These circular dependencies were harmless in Spring (e.g., QueueService ↔ Worker) but immediately fail in Python.
This is because Python imports are executed eagerly, not scanned lazily. (I believe I literally had the @Lazy Spring
annotation in some of my SpringQueue .java files). But unlike Spring’s component scanning and dependency injection—which
resolve references after class loading—Python requires modules to be fully initialized at import time. This means that
import order matters and cycles must be broken explicitly (mirroring Go’s explicit wiring model). This required
restructuring imports to avoid top-level circular references and reinforced that PyQueue’s bootstrap
phase more closely resembles GoQueue than SpringQueue.
